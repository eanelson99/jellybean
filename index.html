          Design Decisions:
          Our theme is the BEACH! We would rather be out in the sun and by the water than in this cold rainy weather. That was our inspiration.
          We chose to do a blue gradient from right to left to represent the ocean water because as the water gets deeper, it gets darker and naturally that would be further away from the sand, just like ours.
          To add dimension to the sand bar, we did a box-shadow. It was intended to give the effect of a real life sand bar floating in the water.
          The beach is light and airy so we made our font color and borders light. The beach is also thought of in the same category of summer, so in that sense, our theme colors also needed to be light.
          We added images to myAccount and seating. These images were intentional as it carried the theme of being at the beach throughout the website. This made the theme more cohesive.
          On the "grades" page, we utilized a beach ball border to add color and intrigue to the page.
          Seashells that ended up looking like nautical ropes was the border-image for the current day as to draw the viewer's focus onto what's most important. Also, it provides a decision between prep and completed days.
          We added animation that rocks the h1 back and forth to symbolize the motion of the waves going in and out.
          We also made some stylistic choices to improve the appearance of the page such as font, font-size, circular image, rounded border, and hover to emphasis the possible pages you could be visiting.
          In addition, the sizes of the padding and margins and the position of the header, body, h1 etc. were taken into accoutn.
          For all these reasons mentioned, we incorporated novel uses of CSS to pair layout with coherent theme; we provided intentional, documented design decisions to support your theme through visual components; and we have clever interaction based on theme.
